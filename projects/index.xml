      <description>First Persian baby care app for Iranian mothers. This app measures baby&amp;rsquo;s weight, height, and every other required measurement. It also records diaper changes, breastfeedings, sleep, medications, vaccinations, diaries, bottle feedings, foods, baths, doctor visitations, activities, and teeth details. A busy mother won&amp;rsquo;t forget anything about her child because everything will be reminded to her, e.g., today is the vaccination day, or now is the time for a diaper change.</description>
