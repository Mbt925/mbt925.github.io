      <description>J2ME (Java Mobile) development was not like Android or iOS development with rich GUI toolkits. The existing ui elements were poor and there were many missing. There were no Table, Tab, Menu, Chart, or Tree components. BehNama was my solution to this problem - A rich GUI toolkit. I implemented many well-known components for J2ME developers. My all-time favorite was a bitmap keyboard.

      <description>Once upon a time, dialup internet connection was a thing :). Internet connectivity was limited in many aspects, including speed and volume. MBTimer was a tool to keep all the details under controls. It could extract dialup connections&#39; usernames and passwords automatically and list them for you. Then, one could config all the connections with different settings. For example, one could set a maximum daily volume for a connection, or set a timer for connecting/disconnecting.</description>

      <description>At around 2009-2010, I was into translating movies and tv series. The popular apps at the time had some issues with RTL languages and BiDi texts. I wrote MBTranslator assitant using C# to tackle those issues. Fortunately, it was accepted by many of the Persian translators.

      <description>My team and I participated in an international Persian digits competition held by the University of Birjand at PRIA 2013 pattern recognition conference and image analysis conference. Our solution was based on an MLP neural network trained on a custom training set. The training set was extended from the original one which was available at the competition&amp;rsquo;s website. LBP was used as the feature extractor. Due to the lightweight configuration of the system, the runtime processing speed was quite high (10 ms per image).</description>

      <description>Chartex started with just domestic flights, then extended with international flights, domestic and international hotels, trains, buses and travel insurances. It has both Android and iOS apps which are identical in terms of features. Chartex was a B2B service. So we had to prepare the apps for different businesses with different themes and requirements. We made necessary ad-hoc tools to make this process as automatic as possible. Starting from customizing the required sections (flight, hotel, etc.</description>

      <description>First Persian baby care app for Iranian mothers. This app measures baby&amp;rsquo;s weight, height, and every other required measurement. It also records diaper changes, breastfeedings, sleep, medications, vaccinations, diaries, bottle feedings, foods, baths, doctor visitations, activities, and teeth details. A busy mother won&amp;rsquo;t forget anything about her child because everything will be reminded to her, e.g., today is the vaccination day, or now is the time for a diaper change.</description>
