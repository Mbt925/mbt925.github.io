My name is **Mohsen Biglari** or **محسن بیگلری** in Persian. I am Iranian, and if you want to know exactly where, I am from Galugah (گلوگاه), [Babol, Mazandaran](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babol). I am <span id="age"> years, day(s) and second(s)</span> old.

My favorite sports are soccer and swimming. From elementary school to high school, I was always in the soccer teams of my schools. However, finding free time for a group sport now is much harder than before.

I am in love with animals, especially birds and fish. I hate killing or trading them. It might be odd, but I have some experiences as a stockman (or a breeder, in a tiny scale). I kept and raised different kinds of mammals (i.e., Sheep, Cow, Goat), birds, and fishes when I was younger! Ah, good old days.

I love programming, and I have some experiences with some programming languages like VB6, C, C++, Java, C#\.Net, VB.Net, MATLAB, Python, Java Mobile, iOS (Objective-C, Swift), and Android (Java, Kotlin). I am mainly an Android developer, and I do basic web programming just for personal purposes. You can have a look at my last projects from [here](/allprojects).

I got my B.Sc. in Software Engineering at 2010, and my M.Sc. at 2012, both from the [University of Kashan](https://kashanu.ac.ir/en). I finished my doctoral's in Computer Science at 2017 from [Shahrood University of Technology (SUT)](http://shahroodut.ac.ir/en/).

Starting from Sep. 2018, I was an assistant professor at [Shahrood University of Technology (SUT)](http://shahroodut.ac.ir/en/) for almost two years. It led me into rethinking about my goals. Now, I am working at [Tomorrow Bank](http://tomorrow.one/), and I love the company's mission and vision. I am contributing towards a better tomorrow for everyone.
