J2ME (Java Mobile) development was not like Android or iOS development with rich GUI toolkits. The existing ui elements were poor and there were many missing. There were no Table, Tab, Menu, Chart, or Tree components. BehNama was my solution to this problem - A rich GUI toolkit. I implemented many well-known components for J2ME developers. My all-time favorite was a bitmap keyboard.
