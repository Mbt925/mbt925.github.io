First Persian baby care app for Iranian mothers. This app measures baby's weight, height, and every other required measurement. It also records diaper changes, breastfeedings, sleep, medications, vaccinations, diaries, bottle feedings, foods, baths, doctor visitations, activities, and teeth details. A busy mother won't forget anything about her child because everything will be reminded to her, e.g., today is the vaccination day, or now is the time for a diaper change.
