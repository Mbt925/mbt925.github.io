Once upon a time, dialup internet connection was a thing :). Internet connectivity was limited in many aspects, including speed and volume. MBTimer was a tool to keep all the details under controls. It could extract dialup connections' usernames and passwords automatically and list them for you. Then, one could config all the connections with different settings. For example, one could set a maximum daily volume for a connection, or set a timer for connecting/disconnecting. MBTimer could even estimate the price based on the daily/weekly/monthly usage. It's pretty popular back at the time. You can try googling it with a phrase like "MBTimer 2.2.0". I wrote it via VB6.
